Description: RMV2.0 is an open-source R package for performing measurement and
    verification 2.0 (M&V 2.0)for Commercial Buildings. Aimed to run locally,
    the package provides algorithms and a graphical user interface (GUI) based
    on Shiny package. The intent of this package is to help M&V practitioners
    to perform with a high level of automation the following: quickly and
    easily summarize and visualize smart meter data Create energy consumption
    baseline models using advanced algorithms; screen smart meter data for
    commercial customers to identify buildings that are well suited to the
    automated M&V approach and use this information to target future
    whole-building projects; quantify savings at both a
    building and portfolio level; identify potential non-routine events (NRE)
    in the post-installation period using statistical methodology.
